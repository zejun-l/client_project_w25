            <p>University Health & Counseling (UHC) supports the health and well-being of the campus community. We are inspired to help students realize their potential, cope with the stresses of life, work productively, and connect meaningfully with others. UHC is made up of Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS), which offers counseling services, and University Health Service (UHS), which offers medical services. This website is about CAPS. For information about UHS, please visit the <a href = "https://uhs.umich.edu/">UHS website.</a></p>
            <p>CAPS is committed to creating an environment based on our values of multicultural, multi-disciplinary and multi-theoretical practices that allow our diverse student body to access care, receive high quality services and take positive pathways to mental health. We are happy to offer both in-person and virtual services. 
            <p>Our Front Desk (Michigan Union 4th Floor) is open and ready to help support you -- staff members are available throughout the day to assist you with your needs to answer questions, and get you to the right place. We can be reached by phone at: (734) 764-8312.</p>
            <p> CAPS has a limited number of <a href = "https://caps.umich.edu/article/private-counseling-rooms">private spaces</a> available for students to connect with their counselor via telecounseling. Please contact the front desk for more information on those private spaces.</p>

            <h2>Mental Health Support Options</h2>
            <h3>On Campus Treatment Resources</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS): </a>Counseling and Psychological Services is committed to providing multicultural and multidisciplinary expert therapeutic support. Clinical services include brief personal therapy for individuals, couples and groups and crisis intervention.</li>
                    <li>University Health Services (UHS): </a>University Health Service offers comprehensive outpatient medical services, conveniently located on central campus.

            <h3>Individual Peer Counseling</h3>
                <p>Individual Peer Counseling (IPC) is designed to offer a new way to meet the needs of students across the University of Michigan. We are here to support student mental health and offer students a place to vent. Peer counselors are trained in active listening by professional staff here at CAPS. The IPC program connects students with someone of a similar age, interest and background who can serve as a resource or simply someone to “rant” to. While Peer Counselors will keep all information private, IPC is not a substitute for confidential therapy provided by a licensed mental health CAPS staff member. </p>
